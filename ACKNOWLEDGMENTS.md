# RESOURCES
These are the resources I used in this project. Some of them are also cited in the code, just above the relevant code. From time to time, I utilized two different [LLMs](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/): [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and [ClaudeAI](https://claude.ai). Code generated by AI is tagged in the comments.

Edit: I'm not experienced with Linux servers and deployments and I used solely ClaudeAI while deploying to Amazon Lightsail's Ubuntu Server.
